# Gemacs Development Plan

## Completed: Autocomplete Popups & Diagnostic Tooltips (`cd07ae3`)

Implemented popup UX matching Ruby Scintilla editors — inline autocomplete dropdown at cursor and floating diagnostic tooltips on hover.

- **Qt idle autocomplete** — Rewrote `lsp-auto-complete!` to use Scintilla native `SCI_AUTOCSHOW` (replaced broken `QCompleter` approach). Added `sci-word-prefix` using `SCI_WORDSTARTPOSITION`. Popup appears on 500ms idle with 3+ char prefix.
- **Qt diagnostic calltips** — Added `lsp-diagnostic-calltip!` using `SCI_CALLTIPSHOW` with severity-colored backgrounds (red/yellow/blue/grey). Auto-shows/hides on idle cursor movement over diagnostic lines.
- **TUI calltip helpers** — Added `show-calltip!`/`cancel-calltip!` in `editor-text.ss`, ready for future TUI LSP integration.
- **gerbil-scintilla** (`ce04f66`) — Added `SCI_WORDSTARTPOSITION`, `SCI_WORDENDPOSITION`, `SCI_ISRANGEWORD`, `SCI_SETMOUSEDWELLTIME`, `SCI_GETMOUSEDWELLTIME` constants.

## Architecture Notes

### TUI Registration Scopes (3-tier)
1. **`editor.ss`** (facade) — has access to all modules; for cross-chain aliases
2. **`editor-extra.ss`** — editor-extra chain scope
3. **`editor-extra-regs.ss`** — editor-cmds chain scope

### Qt Registration Scopes (2-tier)
1. **`qt/commands-aliases.ss`** — chain scope (after commands-parity, before facade)
2. **`qt/commands.ss`** (facade) — for forward-ref functions like `cmd-quit`

### File Size Status
All Qt command files are under the 2000-line limit after comprehensive splits.
26 command files total (13 pairs). Chain order:
```
core → core2 → edit → edit2 → search → search2 → file → file2 →
sexp → sexp2 → ide → ide2 → vcs → vcs2 → lsp → shell → shell2 →
modes → modes2 → config → config2 → parity → parity2 →
aliases → aliases2 → facade
```
Largest files: modes (~1851), lsp (~1802), search (~1778)
| TUI File | Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `editor-extra-media.ss` | ~2013 | Slightly over limit |

Extended `qreplace-finish!` with `*qreplace-files-remaining*` state to auto-advance to next project file. `insert-uuid` / `uuidgen` properly registered in both layers (Qt: calls `/usr/bin/uuidgen`; TUI: already in `editor-cmds-a.ss`). Fix: singleton Scintilla editor now resets `SCI_SETREADONLY 0` at start of each test group. 716 Qt tests.

### Current Status
- **716 Qt tests passing**, all TUI tests passing (vtscreen flaky but known)
- **~2185+ registered commands** across TUI and Qt
- **~650+ implemented features**
- Remaining stubs: 2 niche Qt stubs (all-the-icons-install-fonts, nerd-icons-install-fonts — informational only)
- Remaining yellow circles in gemacs-vs-emacs.md: ~12 (mostly fundamental platform limitations: tree-sitter, EWW CSS/JS, screen reader, tab-line per-window)

### Next Steps (for continuation)
- Continue upgrading remaining stubs per standing instruction
- Potential features: dired improvements (mark by regex, shell command on marked), more text transforms
- Update gemacs-vs-emacs.md after each batch
- Static build verification (`make static-qt`) periodically

### Aspirational
- LSP in TUI (currently delegates to ctags/grep/formatter; full LSP protocol not yet implemented)
- ~~DAP/debugger integration~~ — DONE: real GDB/MI interface in both Qt and TUI (spawn, breakpoints, step, continue, REPL)
- ~~Multi-frame support~~ — DONE: virtual frame management (C-x 5 prefix), make-frame/delete-frame/other-frame
- ~~Spell checking integration~~ — DONE: flyspell-mode, ispell-word, ispell-buffer, ispell-region, dictionary switching (both TUI and Qt)
- ~~TRAMP remote editing~~ — DONE: SSH-based file open/save, remote shell, remote compile
- ~~AI Copilot integration~~ — DONE: OpenAI API inline code completion, copilot-complete/accept/dismiss
